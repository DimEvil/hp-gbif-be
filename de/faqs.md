### What is GBIF?

GBIF—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth.

### What is an Hosted Portal?

Each hosted portal is a simple website hosted and maintained on the GBIF infrastructure. The programme complements other tools available through the network by lowering the technical threshold for maintaining a branded web presence displaying a targeted subset of the data and information already available through GBIF.org. see [GBIF Hosted portals](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals) for more

### What can I discover on GBIF.be?

GBIF.be Hosted Portal let you explore **Open Biodiversity Data published about Belgium**. This is all data occurring in Belgium and openly shared through GBIF.
Most of these data are coming from **Belgian Institutions, Public agencies, Scientists and Citizens**, but also from abroad.
