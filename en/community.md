## Our landscape

The **Belgian Biodiversity Platform** collaborates with a variety of actors.

## GBIF.be, a collaborative effort

Since 2002, as the **national GBIF node**, we coordinate the **Belgian Biodiversity Information Facility(BeBIF)**, a collaborative effort including all Belgian actors that share and/or use Biodiversity data through GBIF.
See our [Data Publishers page](/publisher/search) to discover who they are.
Explore our [Literature page](/literature/search) to learn how GBIF mediated data has been reused by scientists or policy makers.
Without the Belgian BIF continous efforts, all this would have not be possible.
We would like to thanks people around the country that contribute over the last twenty years and invite you to join our community either by visiting [Become a publisher page](https://www.gbif.org/become-a-publisher) or by contacting your Node.
